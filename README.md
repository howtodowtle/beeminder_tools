# Beeminder Tools

This repo contains tools that help me use Beeminder. I absolutely love Beeminder for me do what I want to do. It works best with automatic integrations (Strava, Garmin, Project Euler, ...). For tools that have no automatic Beeminder integration but an API (or we can scrape the data), we can use the Beeminder API to automate the process.
